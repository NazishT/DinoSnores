      <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Dino-Snores is a sleep monitoring scheduler that allow the user to monitor his sleep hours and help in setting a smart alarm. The mobile app will be able to track movements during sleep via Fitbit's band accelerometer and would display sleep data in graphs and tables making the user aware of his sleep patterns and the quality of sleep. The user would be able to set a smart alarm which will be designed to wake up the user during the lighter mode of his sleep cycle. The mobile app will be built in addition to the website so that user can view or share the data online anytime. The project will cater to the fitness/health aspect of the project theme and the main purpose of building such an app is to help the user in gaining insight into his sleep cycle and how to make it better for a healthier lifestyle.

 The app will be designed for wider audience of all ages, however, to identify the target niche, it would most effectively benefit full-time working individuals who find it hard to manage their sleep schedule. The users will be able to assess their sleep data, make realistic sleep goals and make their lives healthier by having more quality by using this app. Our design goals include

        <li> making the app easier to use for Fitbit users. </li>

        <li>Having data that is easier to interpret with minimal text and shouldn’t be littered with scientific terminologies. </li>

        <li>Notifying the user if they are not getting enough sleep.</li>

        <li>Smart alarm would wake user up during lighter sleep cycle so that they don’t get shocked by the alarm. </li>

        <li>The sound library would include soft lulling sounds instead of thrilling ones. </li>

      <p>
        Our hardware requirements include a Fitbit Alta or Flex band or a smart watch (Fitbit Versa 2). The software requirements include using Android/HTML for front-end development and Python for backend.

        Quality sleep is a crucial part of everyone’s life. Poor sleep habits can lead to lack of concentration, lack of motivation, confusion, heart problems, and obesity. By developing a sleep monitoring app, we hope to lead the user to a healthier version of themselves. Furthermore, we want both the app and website to be not only attractive, but easy to use. While there are countless benefits to getting more sleep, we want the user to WANT to sleep better. Our app, hopefully, will attract the user because of its simplicity and design.
